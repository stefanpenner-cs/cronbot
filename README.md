# cron-policy

Make GitHub Actions crons durable, watched, and managed.

## The problem

- A cron's "actor" is just the last person to merge a cron change.
- That person leaves. The cron goes quiet. No one is told.
- No owner. No alert. No health check.

## The fix: five small Go tools

- `rehome` — move a cron onto a durable bot account, without changing when it runs.
- `deadman` — find crons that have gone quiet, and alert.
- `cronguard` — block any human cron change. Only `li-cron[bot]` may merge one.
- `cronbot` — turn a cron-request issue into a safe, registered plan.
- `cronreconcile` — de-register crons that were deleted, so the catalog stays honest.

All dry-run or check-only. Nothing here writes to your repos on its own.

## How a cron gets added

1. You file a `cron-request` issue.
2. The bot checks it and comments back.
3. The crew signs off.
4. `li-cron[bot]` lands it. Now the bot owns it. It is durable.

A human who edits a cron directly is stopped by `cronguard` and sent here.

## How a cron gets removed

Removing a cron is safe — once the schedule is gone, nothing runs, so there is
no actor to mis-own. So removal is simple:

1. Delete the `schedule:` cron from the workflow. `cronguard` allows this; no
   request needed.
2. `cronreconcile` runs (on a schedule, as the bot) and drops the now-missing
   cron from the central registry.

So adds are gated and signed-off; removes are free, then the catalog self-heals.

## See it live

Prototype: https://github.com/stefanpenner-cs/cron-policy

- Issue #1 (good): the bot says "valid" and shows the plan.
- Issue #2 (bad): the check goes red and the bot lists the errors.

## Run it

From the repo root:

```
go test ./...                 # all tests
go run ./cmd/deadman          # quiet-cron report
go run ./cmd/rehome           # re-home plan (dry-run)
go run ./cmd/cronbot --issue-body issue.md --request-url URL
go run ./cmd/cronguard --actor "$PR_AUTHOR" --base origin/main path/to/workflow.yml
go run ./cmd/cronreconcile --registry registry.json --crons crons.json --dry-run
```

## More

- `ci/README.md` — how to roll this out across an org or the whole enterprise.
- Owning team is fixed (`ci-cd-platform-reviewers`), not a form field.
- Cadence is read from the cron value, so it is not stored twice.
